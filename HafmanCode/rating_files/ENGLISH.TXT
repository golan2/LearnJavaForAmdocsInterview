Bob Dylan is the pre eminent lyricist and songwriter of his time He re energized 
the folk music genre brought a new lyrical depth to rock and roll when he went electric and bridged the worlds of rock 
and country by recording in Nashville As much as hes played the role of renegade throughout his career Dylan 
has also kept the rock and roll community mindful of its roots by returning often to them With his songs Dylan has 
provided a running commentary on a restless age His biting imagistic and often cryptic lyrics served to capture and 
define the mood of a generation For this hes been elevated to the role of spokesmen   and yet the elusive and reclusive 
Dylan wont even admit to being a poet I dont call myself a 
poet because I dont like the word he has said Im a trapeze artist 
Bob Dylan was born Robert Zimmerman on May 24th 1941 in Duluth Minnesota He learned to 
play harmonica and piano by age ten and taught himself to play the guitar As a high school
student in the late Fifties he listened to Hank Williams and Little Richard and learned how to
play rock and roll While attending the University of Minnesota Dylan traded his electric
guitar for an acoustic and began to pattern himself after hard traveling folksingers of the
previous generation such as his mentor Woody Guthrie In December 1960 Dylan moved to
New York City where he gravitated to the folk and blues scene on Bleecker Street in
Greenwich Village His New York City debut occurred at Gerdes Folk City on April 11th 1961
with Dylan opening for bluesman John Lee Hooker After playing harmonica on a session for
folksinger Carolyn Hester Dylan was signed by producer John Hammond to a contract with
Columbia Records Except for a brief hiatus in the early Seventies Dylan has recorded for and
remained with the label since 1961 
Dylans first album was a stripped down record on which he recorded topical folk songs 
accompanying himself on harmonica and guitar That album contained only two originals
 Song for Woody and Talking New York  although the situation would quickly change
with the almost entirely self composed The Freewheelin Bob Dylan released in May 1963 That
album included such classics as Blowin in the Wind Masters of War and A Hard Rains
A Gonna Fall   songs that astonished the cognoscenti in folk circles and established Dylan as a
formidable composer and presence In early 1964 as the Beatles began conquering young
America the articulate and challenging Dylan occupied the minds of a slightly older set He
released two albums that year: The Times They Are a Changin his most overtly
message oriented album and Another Side of Bob Dylan which represented the artist in a more
introspective and personal guise with such songs as My Back Pages and It Aint Me Babe 
Dylans gradual move from folk to rock and roll was inspired by the Beatles  whom Dylan 
secretly dug  and the Byrds  whose electrified folk rock arrangement of 
Dylans then unreleased Mr Tambourine Man eventually went to Number One in June 1965  
Dylan tested the waters with Bringing It All Back Home one side of which was acoustic and the 
other electric His lyrics were as literate and demanding as ever but on songs like Subterranean 
Homesick Blues they were now set to slangy ramshackle rock and roll In May 1965 Dylan 
undertook his first tour of the UK toting an acoustic guitar and an often confrontational 
attitude That stormy affair was documented in stark black and white by filmmaker DA Pennebaker 
in Dont Look Back Dylan returned to the States fit for battle and the next skirmish occurred 
with the folk music crowd that had so revered him On July 25th 1965 Dylan strode onstage at 
the Newport Festival with an electric guitar in hand and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band 
backing him up He was booed offstage after only three songs at which point he returned 
with an acoustic guitar and a message for all the folk purists: Its All Over Now Baby Blue
